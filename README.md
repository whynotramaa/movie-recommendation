# Movie Recommendation

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation project‚Äîa dynamic movie search and recommendation platform built with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS. This guided project is my first full-fledged build, where I learned the ins and outs of modern web development while crafting a sleek, responsive UI and integrating powerful features.

## Overview

This project is a movie search platform designed to provide real-time movie data with a user-friendly experience. It leverages the TMDB API to fetch movie details, while a trending section powered by Appwrite tracks search counts and displays the hottest picks. With debounced search functionality, the app minimizes unnecessary API calls, keeping the server happy and the experience smooth.

## Features

- **Sleek UI:** Built with Tailwind CSS to ensure a modern and responsive design.
- **Debounced Search:** Optimized search input to prevent excessive API calls.
- **Real-Time Movie Data:** Integration with the TMDB API provides up-to-date movie information.
- **Trending Section:** Utilizes Appwrite to track search counts and spotlight the top 5 movies.
- **Top 20 Movies:** Intended to showcase the most popular movies (currently under troubleshooting due to CORS issues).
